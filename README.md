Asset, Node, and Digital Rewards Engine Whatchamacallit

## Proof-of-Performance 
Nodes are rewarded based on the measured, economic utility of the good or service represented by the node. The main characteristics of PoP are:
* Asset creators assign URIs to their assets
* Metrics are collected for the assets
* A communal resource pool is allocated
* The asset creator allows their URIs to be tokenized by others

A rewards engine divvies out the token supply to URI NFTs in proportion to the NFTs' measured performance. Usage is measured in most cases by sending service request through the RUDI and PBR proxies. Proof-of-Authority is used to determine who is allowed to publish metrics, while a DAO is used to determine which performers receive rewards and in what proportion.

## The DAO

The A.N.D.R.E.W. DAO model uses a democratic governance model, with representive aspects, and features a Proof-of-Authority monitor.
